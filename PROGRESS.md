# secsec — progress tracker

Running status of milestones (M), risks (R), and forward-carried debts. Updated as work lands.
(`finaldesign.md` = spec; `IMPLEMENTATION.md` = plan.)

## Snapshot

- **20 crates + `secsec` binary** (+ `xtask` tooling, `fuzz/` cargo-fuzz layout) · 255 tests · clippy
  `-D warnings` + fmt clean · spec↔code↔doc consistent.
- **Full-source audit (2026-06-10):** read all ~18.3k LoC + the spec. Found **one** soundness/conformance
  defect — `secsec-pq` was non-conformant X-Wing (label-first + two independent seeds, hidden by an
  ignored KAT). Fixed + KAT-proven against the draft-10 vector. Then closed the §8.2 DATA key-history
  gap. Everything else is conformant; the rest are unbuilt spec features (below).
- **The product runs:** `secsec init` / `serve` / `sync` (+ `--watch`) — two devices live-sync a folder through a
  blind server over QUIC, concurrent, no data loss. Verified end-to-end with real processes.
- **All forward-carried debt (#6–16) closed.** M0–M7 functionally complete for v1 (RSA + WebDAV dropped).

## Milestones

| M | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| M0 Foundation | canon/aead/kdf/frame | ✅ done |
| M1 Object plane | object/chunk/store, snapshot/restore | ✅ done |
| M2 Identity & roster | sigchain, keyslots, generations, rotate/revoke, SAS primitives | ✅ done · ⚠️ interactive grant ceremony not wired |
| M3 Sync | head, dag, merge, rollback gates, fork detection | ✅ done |
| M4 Transport | QUIC pinned verifier, §12 wire + server pipeline, limits | ✅ done |
| M5 Live sync | watcher, concurrent multi-client, clone/publish/pull/merge, init, frontier seal, `sync --watch` | ✅ done |
| M6 Durability & recovery | see below | ✅ **done** |
| M7 Later | PQ keyslot (X-Wing), stdio/SSH transport | ✅ **done** (RSA + WebDAV **dropped**) |

### M7 detail — done

- ✅ §17 hybrid-PQ keyslot (`secsec-pq`: X-Wing = ML-KEM-768 + X25519). **draft-10 conformant:**
  single-seed `SHAKE256(sk,96)` key expansion, **label-LAST** combiner, FIPS 203 §7.1 PCT.
  `xwing_kat` asserts byte-identity vs the draft-10 Appendix C vector (passing, **not** ignored).
  (Was non-conformant — label-first + two independent seeds — concealed by the ignored KAT; fixed.)
  **Not yet wired** into the `algo_id`/keyslot flow (reachable via a future `SetMinAlgo` bump).
- ✅ §11 stdio/SSH transport core: `SessionTranscript::new_stdio(H)` channel-binds the SSH exchange hash;
  `stream.rs` length-prefixed framing over any `AsyncRead`/`AsyncWrite` (alloc-bomb-guarded), `host_id =
  BLAKE3(K_S)`. **Follow-up (deployment-only, no security gain over pinned QUIC):** wiring a live `russh`
  subsystem to source `H`/`K_S` — this module is the transport-agnostic framing it rides on.

### M6 detail — all done

- ✅ §8.5 local frontier persistence (sealed under SSH-key)
- ✅ §8.6 recovery keyslot (`secsec-recovery`: code + passphrase/Argon2id, mk_commit-verified)
- ✅ §16 min-algo — verified complete for v1 (min_algo folded + compile-time floor; per-fetch algo check is M7)
- ✅ §15 `all_heads_hash` bug fixed (server-visible head-blob hashes, not encrypted head_version)
- ✅ §15 GC orchestration — arrival receipts + `gc` wire op + CAS-serialized handler + client driver
  (live-QUIC proven: sweeps garbage, keeps reachable, CAS fails on stale state). **R6 fully closed.**
- ✅ §14 multi-remote + quorum — `client::multiremote`: quorum put→get→verify (P15), sigchain
  cross-remote reconciliation (longest valid chain + rollback alarms), per-ref head-rollback detection.
- ✅ §10/§14 gossip — `client::gossip::cross_remote_fork_scan`: DAG-incomparable head detection across
  remotes → ForkEvent audit records (§10 step 3).

**M6 follow-ups (all done):** ✅ receipt host-key signature (§15 defence-in-depth); ✅ fork-event
log to disk; ✅ device-to-device gossip transport (thin layer over the same fork check).

## Risks

R1 verifier, R2 CTX, R3 HPKE, R4 rollback-merge, R5 fold/cold-start, R6 GC, R7 canonical, R8 keyed-CDC
— **all closed**.

## Forward-carried debts — all closed (tasks #6–16)

Worked through smallest→largest, tested+committed per slice:

- [x] #6 drop RSA + WebDAV from scope (spec/plan/tracking)
- [x] #7 `--host-fp` fingerprint pinning (verifier hash-compare path; CLI flag)
- [x] #8 fork-event log to disk (§10 step 3 audit persistence)
- [x] #9 receipt host-key signature (§15 defence-in-depth)
- [x] #10 device-to-device gossip transport (thin layer over fork_check)
- [x] #11 **fuzz targets** (§3 CI gate — one per decoder + stable robustness harness)
- [x] #12 `xtask` (reproducible musl build recipe + mechanical vector generation, 26 KATs)
- [x] #13 rotation flow + rotation-era cold-start (§8.2/§8.4; removes genesis-only restriction)
- [x] #14 interactive grant ceremony (§7 SAS enrollment of a 2nd device)
- [x] #15 M7 hybrid-PQ keyslot (X-Wing)
- [x] #16 M7 stdio/SSH transport (transcript channel-binding + generic byte-stream framing)

Dropped from scope: RSA device keys, WebDAV.
## Conformance gaps (unbuilt spec features — *absent*, not *wrong*)

The classical crypto/protocol/sync/transport/server/storage stack is conformant and tested (252
tests, KATs, proptests, model-based differential fold test, live-QUIC e2e, fuzz-on-stable). The
full-source audit (2026-06-10) found **one** soundness defect — `secsec-pq` was non-conformant
X-Wing — now fixed and KAT-proven. The remaining gaps are unimplemented spec features:

- ✅ **§8.2 DATA key-history** (`/keyhist/<g>`) — **done** (kdf `data_keyhist_key`, roster
  `seal/open/peel_data_keys`, store `KEYHIST`, `GetKeyhist` wire op, `rotate_repo` producer,
  `data_keyring`/`data_keyring_remote`). A fresh cold-started device peels the keyring and reads
  pre- *and* post-rotation objects (proven in-process + over live QUIC). **Remaining consumer:**
  auto-select the per-object generation inside `fetch_closure`/`restore` for full rotation-era LIVE
  sync (the sync loop still runs at the genesis generation today).
- **X-Wing `algo_id` integration** — the conformant keyslot exists but no `algo_id` reaches it;
  `repo.rs` always uses the classical HPKE slot. Needs a FRAME `algo_id` + a device X-Wing-key
  enrollment decision (derive the seed from the SSH scalar? publish in `AddDevice`?) + `SetMinAlgo`.
- **§7 SAS rate-limit** (5/hr per D_pubkey), **§16 per-fetch `min_algo`** on keyslots (keyslots need
  a FRAME/`algo_id` first), **§8.1 `HistoryReanchor`** (`finalrew.md` flags it as spec-unsound — a
  fresh device can't decrypt dropped generations to verify succession; needs a signed
  membership-snapshot baseline), and CLI surfaces `rotate`/`grant`/`recover`/`gc` (cores operate on a
  local `Store`; wiring to the remote model is real work). All absent.
- Live `russh` stdio `H`/`K_S` wiring (deployment-only, no security gain over pinned QUIC).

Residual (not debt): §8.5 seal-before-push ordering is conservative (crash-safe via FF retry).

## Log (most recent first)

- **All debt closed.** #16 stdio/SSH transport: `new_stdio(H)` transcript binding + generic
  `AsyncRead`/`AsyncWrite` framing (alloc-guarded). #15 X-Wing PQ keyslot (`secsec-pq`). #14 grant
  ceremony (`grant_device`, SAS commitment). #13 rotation (`rotate_repo`, multi-gen cold-start,
  per-gen sealing). #12 `xtask` (musl recipe + 26-KAT generator). #11 fuzz (7 targets + robustness
  harness). #10 gossip codec + fork log. #9 signed arrival receipts. #8 fork-event disk log. #7
  `--host-fp` pinning. #6 RSA/WebDAV dropped.
- Fixed §15 `all_heads_hash` (head-blob hashes). Recovery crate (§8.6). Min-algo verified (§16).
- Closed concurrency caveats: lock-free store (interior-mutable server state, `Arc<Server>`), racing-writers test.
- `restore` preserves mtime/mode → snapshot idempotent (fixed clone-then-sync CommitReplay).
- `sync --watch` continuous loop; server now serves clients concurrently.
- `secsec sync` runnable; bidirectional `sync_once` with base-tracking; cold-start over remote.
- `secsec init` (§7 genesis) + cold-start; get-roster/get-keyslot/get-ref wire ops.
